## What is AI?

AI is an acronym that stands for Artificial Intelligence. It refers of the development of computer systems that are able to perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech analyzation, decision-making, and translating languages

## What is the Central Concept of AI?

The main concept of AI is the ability of machines to learn from data and improve their performance over time. This is achievsed through machine learning algorithms. They are sets of instructions that are used to analyze data and make predictions or decisions.

## How does AI Work?

The workflow of AI typically involves the following steps:

<section>
  <h3>1. Data Collection</h3>
  Gathering data relevant to the problem or task that the AI is intended to solve.
</section>

<section>
  <h3>2. Data Preprocessing</h3>
  Cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data for use in the machine learning algorithm.
</section>

<section>
  <h3>3. Training for module</h3>
  Using the machine learning algorithm to analyze the data and make predictions or make decisions.
</section>

<section>
  <h3>4. Evaluation</h3>
  Testing the performance of the AI system and making it as what is nessearcy
</section>

<section>
  <h3>5. Deployment</h3>
  Integrating the AI system into a larger system or application.
