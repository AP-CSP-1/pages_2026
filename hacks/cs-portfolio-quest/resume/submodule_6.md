# Submodule 6

# Performing Well in a Tech Interview

This lesson teaches how to communicate clearly and professionally during a technical interview. It focuses on vocal tone, pacing, body language, what artifacts or demos to show, and a step-by-step preparation checklist. Use the exercises to practice and build confidence.

## Learning Goals

- Understand how tone and pacing affect perceived competence and fit.
- Use body language to project confidence while staying approachable.
- Know what to show (projects, code, demos) and how to present them.
- Follow a repeatable preparation checklist before interviews.
- Practice with mock prompts and review feedback using the exercises.

## 1. Mindset Before the Interview

- Treat the interview as a conversation, not an interrogation. You're both evaluating fit.
- Aim to be curious, clear, and honest. If you don't know something, show how you'd find the answer.
- Remember: it’s okay to pause to think — silence for a few seconds is better than rushing a wrong answer.

## 2. Vocal Tone, Pacing, and Language

- Tone: Use a calm, confident tone. Be enthusiastic when describing things you built, neutral and curious when exploring unknowns.
- Pacing: Speak moderately — not too fast (nervous), not too slow (uncertain). Use short, clear sentences.
- Volume: Project your voice slightly more than normal for video calls; ensure you’re not too loud on in-person interviews.
- Phrase choices:
  - Use “I” to own your work (e.g., "I designed the data model...").
  - Use hedging sparingly: replace "I think" with "My approach would be..." when you’re confident.
  - When asked about tradeoffs, structure answers: state option, list pros, list cons, state your preference and why.

### Quick voice checklist

- Breathe before answering.
- Start with a one-sentence summary, then expand with details.
- Use signposting: "First I'll..., then I'll..." to keep the interviewer oriented.

## 3. Body Language (In-person & Video)

General principles:
- Open posture: avoid crossing arms; keep a relaxed, straight back.
- Eye contact: aim for regular eye contact; on video, look at the camera occasionally, but primarily engage with the interviewer on-screen.
- Hands: use natural gestures to emphasize points; avoid fidgeting.
- Smile: a small, genuine smile at natural moments improves warmth and rapport.

Video-specific tips:
- Camera at eye level or slightly above.
- Sit at a comfortable distance so your upper torso and hands are visible when gesturing.
- Good lighting from the front; reduce backlighting.
- Mute notifications and close distracting tabs.

## 4. What to Show: Projects, Code, and Demos

- Prioritize polished, demonstrable work: a working demo trumps raw code in many contexts.
- For code reviews or whiteboard problems:
  - Explain the problem and constraints first.
  - Outline a high-level approach before writing code.
  - Walk through edge cases and complexity (time/space).
- If showing a project/demo:
  - Prepare a 60–90 second "demo script" that highlights purpose, your role, tech stack, and one meaningful metric or lesson.
  - Have a short list of 2–3 technical decisions you can explain (architecture, a tricky bug, performance tradeoff).

## 5. Preparing Your Artifacts (Practical Steps)

- Local copies: Keep a minimal, well-organized repo or a prepared demo link (hosted or local) ready to share.
- README: Ensure each showcased project has a short README with setup and a short description of your role.
- Shortlist: Pick 3 projects you know deeply and can discuss for 10+ minutes each.
- Code hygiene: Clean, commented, and small focused files are easier to review live.

## 6. Common Interview Formats & How to Approach Them

- Whiteboard/On-Call Coding:
  - Talk through the approach out loud.
  - Start with a simple solution, then optimize.
- System design:
  - Clarify requirements and constraints.
  - Sketch components, data flow, and failure modes.
- Behavioral/Culturally-fit:
  - Use STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) for structured answers.
- Pair-programming:
  - Ask clarifying questions, communicate intent, and share your screen or cursor clearly.

## 7. Short Scripts & Example Phrases

- Opening introduction (30–45s): "Hi — I’m [Name]. I’m a software engineer with X years building Y. Recently I led the design of [project], where I focused on [area]. I’m excited to learn about this role and share how I can contribute."

- When you need time to think: "Great question — let me take 15–20 seconds to think through the approach. I’ll outline the steps I’d take."

- If you don’t know something: "I haven’t used that specific tool before, but here’s how I’d approach learning/using it: ..." or "I’d reach for [resource], run a small prototype, and validate assumptions."

- Closing: "Thank you for the question. I enjoyed discussing X. May I ask about the team’s current priorities for this role?"

## 8. Practice Exercises

1. 60-Second Pitch
   - Task: Record a 60-second intro that covers who you are, what you build, and a recent achievement.
   - Success: Clear, 3–4 sentence narrative, 45–60 seconds.

2. Mock Coding Round
   - Task: Pair with a peer or record yourself solving an algorithm problem out loud. Focus on clarifying questions and talking through complexity.
   - Success: You clearly state assumptions, outline an approach, and iterate to a working solution.

3. Demo Walkthrough
   - Task: Prepare a 90-second demo script for one project. Practice showing it in under 2 minutes.
   - Success: Demo runs or plays smoothly; you emphasize impact and technical choices.

4. Video Self-review
   - Task: Conduct a mock interview on video, then watch the recording and note 3 things to improve (tone, pacing, posture).

## 10. Feedback & Iteration

- After each interview, write a quick self-review: what went well, what stumbled, and one specific action to improve.
- Keep a short log of feedback and track measurable improvements (e.g., reduced filler words, faster whiteboard drafts).
