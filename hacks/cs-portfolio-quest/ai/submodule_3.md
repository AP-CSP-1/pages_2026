## **MODULE 3: Professional Applications**
*Use AI for resumes, interviews, and knowing when NOT to use AI*

### Comic Strip 1: "Resume Transformation"
**Read:**
- Generic bullets don't get interviews. Quantified STAR-format bullets do.
- **STAR Method**:
  - **S**ituation: Set context
  - **T**ask: Your responsibility
  - **A**ction: What you did
  - **R**esult: Outcome with metrics
- **Before/After Examples**:
  - ‚ùå "Worked on team projects"
  - ‚úÖ "Collaborated with 4-person team to build full-stack web app, reducing page load time by 40% through database query optimization"
  - ‚ùå "Helped with coding"
  - ‚úÖ "Implemented JWT authentication system using Flask and React, securing 10,000+ user accounts with 99.9% uptime"
- **How to use AI**: "Transform this bullet into STAR format with quantifiable metrics: [your bullet]" ‚Üí Compare 3 versions ‚Üí Pick most honest one

**Interact:**
- **Resume Bullet Transformer**:
  - Student pastes weak bullet point
  - AI generates 3 STAR versions: Conservative, Balanced, Bold
  - Student picks one and explains why they chose it
  - Shows comparison table of all 3 with pros/cons
- **ATS Keyword Scanner** (simpler option):
  - Paste bullet ‚Üí Tool highlights missing keywords for target job
  - Suggests: "Add: React, PostgreSQL, API design"

**Submit:**
"Paste one weak bullet from your resume. Then paste the AI-improved STAR version you'll actually use. Explain: Why did you pick this version? What makes it honest and strong?"

### Comic Strip 2: "Interview Prep That Works"
**Read:**
- **The 3 Questions You MUST Nail**:
  1. **"Tell me about a time you failed"**
     - What they want: Self-awareness, learning, growth
     - Structure: Situation ‚Üí What went wrong ‚Üí What you learned ‚Üí How you improved
     - ‚ùå Don't: Blame others, pick a personal issue, say "I don't fail"
     - ‚úÖ Do: Own it, show what you learned, prove you applied the lesson
  2. **"Walk me through [project name] architecture"**
     - What they want: Technical depth, decision-making, trade-offs
     - Structure: High-level overview ‚Üí Dive into 2-3 key components ‚Üí Explain why you chose them
     - ‚ùå Don't: Jump straight to tiny details, memorize a script
     - ‚úÖ Do: Start broad, go deep when asked, explain trade-offs
  3. **"Why are you interested in this company?"**
     - What they want: You actually researched them, fit with their needs
     - ‚ùå Don't: "Great culture", "learning opportunity" (everyone says this)
     - ‚úÖ Do: Reference their tech stack, recent projects, specific problems you can solve
- **How AI helps**: Record yourself, get AI feedback on filler words ("um", "like"), STAR structure, specificity, timing

**Interact:**
- **Mock Interview Analyzer**:
  - Text area: Student types answer to one of the 3 questions
  - AI analyzes for:
    - Filler words (count + percentage)
    - STAR structure (present/missing components)
    - Specificity score (1-10)
    - Length (too short/just right/too long)
  - Gives specific feedback: "Add metrics to your result. Remove 'like' - used 7 times."
- **Interview Answer Builder**:
  - Fill-in template for STAR method
  - Shows word count in real-time
  - Suggests: "Add a number here" "Be more specific about the result"

**Submit:**
"Write your answer to ONE of the 3 questions (250 words max). Use STAR format. Then list: What would you improve about this answer?"

### Comic Strip 3: "When AI Helps (and When It Doesn't)"
**Read:**
- **AI Integration: When It Actually Helps**:
  - ‚úÖ Summarizing long documents/emails
  - ‚úÖ Generating meeting notes with action items
  - ‚úÖ Quick data analysis in Sheets (trends, charts)
  - ‚úÖ Draft responses to common questions
  - ‚úÖ Extracting key points from research papers
  - ‚úÖ Brainstorming ideas/approaches
- **When It DOESN'T Help**:
  - ‚ùå Technical/specialized content (AI guesses)
  - ‚ùå Legal or medical documents (liability risk)
  - ‚ùå Anything requiring 100% accuracy
  - ‚ùå Math proofs or complex calculations
  - ‚ùå Real-time/current event info (past cutoff date)
- **Red Flags for Unreliable AI Output**:
  - üö© Gives different answers to same question
  - üö© Overly detailed when you asked for summary (hallucination)
  - üö© No sources provided for factual claims
  - üö© Generic advice when you need specifics
  - üö© "As of my knowledge cutoff..." (info might be outdated)
- **Fallback Strategy**: Break requests into smaller chunks, verify critical facts manually, have backup manual workflow, don't rely on AI for time-sensitive work

**Interact:**
- **Use Case Sorter (Drag & Drop)**:
  - Two buckets: "Good AI Use" vs "Bad AI Use"
  - 12 scenario cards to sort:
    - "Summarize 50-page research paper" ‚Üí Good
    - "Generate legal contract for startup" ‚Üí Bad
    - "Write SQL query for database" ‚Üí Good
    - "Diagnose chest pain symptoms" ‚Üí Bad
    - "Brainstorm app feature ideas" ‚Üí Good
    - "Calculate structural load for bridge" ‚Üí Bad
  - Instant feedback: "Correct! Legal documents need human lawyers."
  - Score: 10/12 correct
- **Red Flag Detector**:
  - Show 3 AI responses
  - Student identifies which ones have red flags and why
  - Example: "This response has no sources and gives different info than last time"

**Submit:**
"Describe one task where AI SAVED you time. Then describe one task where you should NOT use AI. Explain why for both (2-3 sentences each)."
