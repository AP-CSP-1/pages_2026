## Plagiarism Case Studies (Activation)

This section is designed to help instructors and lesson designers visualize ways to activate student learning by connecting plagiarism to real people, large financial consequences, and social issues. The goal is to keep this lo-fi and open-ended, encouraging creative approaches for future development.

- **Purpose:**
  - Relate plagiarism to significant figures, money, and social impact.
  - Spark student curiosity and discussion about why plagiarism matters.
  - Provide a flexible, low-fidelity storyboard for lesson prototyping.

### Storyboard Prototype Placeholders

- **Text:**
  - Short, impactful case descriptions (e.g., who was involved, what happened, what was at stake).
  - Simple guiding questions (e.g., "What could have been done differently? Why does this matter?").
- **Visuals:**
  - Placeholder images for each case (e.g., author photos, book covers, news headlines).
  - Simple icons to represent money, legal action, or public attention.
- **Audio:**
  - Placeholder for brief audio clips (e.g., news soundbite, instructor summary).
- **Interactions:**
  - Clickable or hoverable elements to reveal more details or discussion prompts.
  - Option for students to vote or comment on which case they find most surprising or important.
