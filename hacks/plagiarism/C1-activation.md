## Activation: What Really Happens When Plagiarism Is Discovered?

Plagiarism isn't just a classroom rule—it's a real-world issue with serious, sometimes career-changing consequences. The following case studies show what actually happens when plagiarism is uncovered, from bestselling authors to world-famous musicians and public figures. Each case is factual, with documented outcomes: lawsuits, lost money, damaged reputations, and public scrutiny.

As you review these cases, consider:

- How did plagiarism affect the people involved?
- What were the financial, legal, and social consequences?
- How could proper citation or attribution (like APA style) have changed the outcome?

These are not hypotheticals—these are real events. Let’s see what’s at stake when credit isn’t given where it’s due.
