## Why Development Tools Matter

Development tools are the foundation of modern software engineering. They enable collaboration, streamline workflows, and make coding more efficient. In this course, you'll learn to use tools like GitHub, Visual Studio Code, and Jupyter Notebooks to build, test, and share your projects. These tools will not only help you succeed in this class but also prepare you for real-world software development.
