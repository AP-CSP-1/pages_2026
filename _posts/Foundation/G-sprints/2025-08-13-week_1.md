## Week 1: Discover & Design

Week 1 sets the stage for agile product development. Your goal is to empathize with users, define your direction, and begin prototyping. This is the heart of Design Thinking â€” a human-centered approach to building software that matters.

### Days 1â€“2: EMPATHY & DEFINITION

#### GagnÃ© Ceremonies

These structured sessions will help launch the week:

* **Gain Attention**: Understand why your project matters
* **Set Objectives**: Clarify your success metrics
* **Provide Guidance**: Use the rubric as a guide to outcomes

#### Design Thinking Activities

Use empathy to understand real user needs:

* **Empathy Interviews or User Research**: Conduct interviews with potential users or stakeholders
* **Define Your POV (Point of View)**: Summarize user needs and insights into one focused statement
* **Frame HMW (How Might We...) Prompts**: Convert POV into actionable design challenges

*Recommended Reading:*

* [IDEOâ€™s Design Thinking Process](https://designthinking.ideo.com/)
* [Interaction Design Foundation: What is Design Thinking?](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/design-thinking)

### Day 3: IDEATION & PLANNING

#### Visual Idea Sharing

* **PinUps**: Share early sketches or whiteboard-style ideas
* Visualize possible user flows, layouts, or systems

#### Agile Planning Setup

* **Create a Kanban Board**: Use [GitHub Projects](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/planning-and-tracking-with-projects/learning-about-projects/about-projects) or physical cards
* Add your first **User Stories** and **Tasks**
* Practice creating **Issues** to track progress and priorities

ðŸ“– *Explore Agile Roles and Boards:*

* [Scrum.org: What is a Kanban board?](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-kanban)
* [Agile User Stories ](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories)[**Tutorial**](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/agile/user-stories)

---

### Day 4: PROTOTYPING

#### Create Low-Fidelity Prototypes

Use any of the following tools:

* **UI Mockups**: [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) or [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
* **Architecture/Models**: [Draw.io](https://draw.io/) or Markdown diagrams

#### Submit for Feedback

* Organize your prototype assets
* Submit to your **Product Owner** (your teacher) for initial feedback

 *Prototyping Tips:*

* [Canva Wireframe Templates](https://www.canva.com/wireframes/)
* [Figma Beginner's Guide](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040514073-Learn-Figma)

## End of Week 1 Goals

* Completed empathy interviews and a defined POV
* Clear HMW questions framed for ideation
* Visual ideas shared in a PinUp
* Kanban board with user stories and issues set up
* At least one low-fidelity prototype submitted to the Product Owner

By the end of this sprint, youâ€™ll have laid the user-centered foundation for your project. Week 2 will bring those ideas to life through code!
