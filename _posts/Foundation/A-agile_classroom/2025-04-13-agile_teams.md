## Team Building and Diversity

In my personal journey, I find myself rooted in Abrahamic spirituality, guided by covenants, obedience, and the centrality of Jesus Christ. This path offers me purpose through steps, actions, and discipleship. I feel my path is closely aligned with the practices of my many Jewish and Muslim friends who also walk the path from the Abrahamic way. In working together with people from these Abrahamic backgrounds, I’ve found that we share a deep commitment to discipline, process, and the careful construction of new ideas and strive to finish products.

Hinduism helps me think about learning how to learn—through concepts like karma, science and astrology, human care, and deeper spiritual dimensions. I’ve found friends and colleagues from this background to be both mindful and deeply caring. Their ability to balance philosophical depth with outcomes is something I deeply admire. They often bring a strong technical drive and focus on building meaningful project outcomes.

Chinese traditions, such as Taoism and Confucianism, emphasize observation, context, and balance. The people I’ve worked with from these traditions are extremely dedicated and methodical, with a strong emphasis on iteration and refinement. Because of their discipline, they often excel in bringing projects across the finish line with excellence. These philosophies ensure projects are carried through to completion with polish and care.

Buddhism, with its roots in mindfulness and enlightenment, has offered me valuable reminders—even though I’ve had fewer Buddhist colleagues. Its principles challenge me to pause, consider others’ perspectives, and express ideas in multiple modes to meet diverse learning needs. It’s a call to express complex ideas in ways that invite understanding—through multiple perspectives, modes, and methods.

Indigenous traditions have always filled me with awe. I grew up with a Navajo friend who seemed deeply at ease with the natural world. I’ve also known many from the Islands of the Sea, where tradition, family, and storytelling shape daily life. Their way of teaching through the earth, examples and shared experience reminds me of the value of narrative. As Engineers, we have the ability to build a culture where knowledge is not just taught, but truly transmitted.

I have found gender to be profoundly impactful in all my engineering practices. Being a male and working in an industry that was dominated by men, I found great balance when we could add female members to our team. Often, adding a female would help in our professionalism, as a gender mix adds to diversity, helps build character in all the participants. As a project starts, ideates, prototypes, and finishes you will realize a far more relatable and finished solution, as opposed to isolated male or female silos.

### From Personal Diversity to Team Building

These diverse backgrounds and perspectives aren't just personal stories—they represent the kinds of complementary strengths that make engineering teams successful.

### Building Teams

🎯 **Today's Task: Building Your Team**

The introduction was my personal opinion and observations. It may not resonate with you and is not meant to make you feel uncomfortable. These are guidelines and observations to help you become successful. The requirement is that you end up on a team.

We'll now be forming teams of 6, organized as two groups of 3.
Later, we'll assign roles and responsibilities, but for now, the key is how you build your team.

❌ **Don't** pick your team based solely on friendships.
✅ **Do** build your team with intentional diversity.

### 🚀 Computer Science teams succeed when there is:

🌍 **Diversity in background**

🎯 **Alignment in goals**

🤝 **Respect for different perspectives**

If you're bringing a friend, great—but only if your team gains diversity and stays goal-aligned. In years of teaching and a lifetime of engineering, all successful projects shared these two traits: diversity and shared purpose.

Ask yourself:

“How do I see myself at the end of this course?”

“Can I imagine myself as a collaborator? A coder? A team leader?”

Build your team with purpose. Look for differences in background and similarities in ambition. Let’s model what it means to create collaborative, cross-perspective teams—just like the world of real engineering.

### 📋 Next Steps

After forming a team you will need to start on the journey of acting as a team and producing as individuals. Here are a couple of activities to get you started.

#### 🎭 **Team Roles & Responsibilities**

* Teams need to consider roles. Some key roles will be discussed in the project requirements for the Sprint.

  👥 Scrum Master → 🏗️ Developer → 🎨 Designer → 📊 Product Owner
  ```

#### 📊 **Progress Management Tools** 

* Teams need to manage progress. At the top of every repository in GitHub there are Issue and Project management tabs. You will need to become familiar with Issues, Kanban, and Timelines.

  ```text
  📋 Issues → 📊 Kanban Board → ⏱️ Timeline → 🚀 Deploy
  ```

#### 🔄 **Agile Ceremonies**

* Ceremonies are key activities for teams. Sticky notes and Scrum boards are a fun and engaging way to start working as a team.
