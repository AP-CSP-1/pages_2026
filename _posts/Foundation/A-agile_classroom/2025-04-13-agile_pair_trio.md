## Pair/Trio Programming Overview

The provided activities evaluates students in a Computer Science Project-based learning course. It focuses on **planning**, **code**, **debugging** and **reviews** to create a holistic profile of each student's computer science and software engineering skills.  It is best to work on these in pairs.

## Evaluation Categories

### 1. Planning

Effective planning ensures that teams stay organized and on track. Use tools like GitHub Issues, Kanban Boards, and Burndown Lists to manage tasks and progress.

- **GitHub Issues**:
  - [ ] Creates clear and descriptive issues for tasks or bugs.
  - [ ] Assigns issues to self and team members appropriately.
  - [ ] Closes issues with meaningful comments or references to commits.

- **Kanban Board**:
  - [ ] Pin-up meeting update the board regularly to reflect task progress.
  - [ ] Work moves tasks through stages (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done).
  - [ ] Uses labels or tags to assign and prioritize tasks effectively.

- **Burndown Lists**:
  - [ ] Tracks progress toward Sprint goals.
  - [ ] Updates the list daily to reflect completed and remaining tasks.
  - [ ] Uses the list to identify blockers and adjust plans.

### 2. Code

Writing and managing code collaboratively is a key part of pair/trio programming. Use tools like Live Share, commits, branches, forks, and pull requests to ensure smooth collaboration.

- **Live Share**:
  - [ ] Actively participates in Live Share sessions with teammates.
  - [ ] Shares the editor and communicates effectively during coding sessions.
  - [ ] Use Live Share to debug or pair program in real time.

- **Commits**:
  - [ ] Makes frequent, meaningful commits with descriptive messages.
  - [ ] Avoids committing large, unrelated changes in a single commit.
  - [ ] Pushes commits regularly to keep the repository updated.

- **Branch Management**:
  - [ ] Creates branches for new features or fixes.
  - [ ] Merges branches only after testing and review.
  - [ ] Deletes branches after they are merged to keep the repository clean.

- **Forks and Pull Requests**:
  - [ ] Creates forks for collaborative projects.
  - [ ] Submits pull requests with clear descriptions and references to issues.
  - [ ] Responds to feedback on pull requests and makes necessary changes.

### 3. Code Review

Code reviews ensure quality and help teammates learn from each other. Focus on comments, pair testing, debugging, and structured reviews.

- **Comments**:
  - [ ] Leave constructive comments on pull requests or commits.
  - [ ] Asks clarifying questions when code is unclear.
  - [ ] Suggests improvements or alternative approaches when appropriate.

- **Pair Testing**:
  - [ ] Tests code written by teammates to ensure functionality.
  - [ ] Identifies edge cases and potential bugs during testing.
  - [ ] Provides feedback on test results and suggests fixes.

- **Debugging**:
  - [ ] Work collaboratively to debug issues.
  - [ ] Uses debugging tools tools with breakpoints and step through code effectively.
  - [ ] Practice the debugging process to get available with features.

- **Code Review**:
  - [ ] Reviews pull requests thoroughly before approving.
  - [ ] Checks for adherence to coding standards and best practices.
  - [ ] Ensures that code is well-documented and maintainable.
