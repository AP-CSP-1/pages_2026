    "FizzBuzz is one of the most common coding interview questions for entry-level software jobs.\n",
    "\n",
    "It looks simple, but it tests essential skills:\n",
    "- Can you write a loop correctly?\n",
    "- Do you know how to use ```if```/```elif```/```else``` conditions?\n",
    "- Can you apply logic with the modulo (%) operator?\n",
    "\n",
    "Employers like it because it quickly shows if a candidate can think logically and translate a problem into working code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Interviewers Ask FizzBuzz:\n",
    "- Weed out resumes vs. reality: Some people list “Python” on their resume but struggle to code basic loops.\n",
    "- Checks fundamentals: Loops, conditionals, operators.\n",
    "- Easy to explain: No complicated setup needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fun Fact: In the early 2000s, FizzBuzz gained popularity after several companies reported that many candidates couldn’t solve it — even with a degree in computer science!"
