    "\n",
    "This Final Project serves as a culmination of your learning in Computer Science Principles, JavaScript, Python, GitHub Pages frontend, and Flask backend. By building a project, you will apply programming fundamentals and explore the impacts of computing through a topic of personal and social relevance, such as Pilot City or Open Coding Society.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will demonstrate your skills in:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Software Engineering Practices:** Planning changes, using checklists, tracking progress (burndowns), writing commented code, and building help documentation.\n",
    "- **Software Development Lifecycle Practices:** Source control, forking, branching, building, testing and verification, pull requests, and merging/integrating.\n",
    "- **Retrospective Engineering Practices:** Presentations, live reviews, demos, code reviews, and revising plans.\n",
    "- **Data Types:** Numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, JSON objects, and SQLite tables.\n",
    "- **Operators:** String operations, mathematical operations, and boolean expressions.\n",
    "- **Control Structures:** Iteration, conditions, nested conditions, try/except, and .then/.catch.\n",
    "- **Input/Output:** HTML5 input, validation, and working with the Document Object Model (DOM).\n",
    "- **Classes:** Writing classes, creating methods, instantiating and using objects, calling methods, using parameters, and handling return values.\n",
    "- **Deployment Practices:** DNS, Docker, docker-compose, and nginx.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is your opportunity to showcase your growth as a developer and your ability to apply computer science principles to real-world problems."
