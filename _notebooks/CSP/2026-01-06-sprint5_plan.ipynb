    "\n",
    "1. **Team Project**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Objective  for Sprint 5.**.  \n",
    "     - **Feature Ready Mileston**.  Iterate on a project so that it is feature ready for Team and Individual CPT requirements.\n",
    "     - **Database Functionality**.  Ensure that data used in system is persistent and dynamic.\n",
    "     - **Deployment**. Ensure backend and database is public and available for group updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Issues/Project Management**\n",
    "      - **Team Issue.** Purpose is project purpose and key features.  Form Issue to serve as a burndown list.   The Team Issue will be used in Team Live reviews and retruspectives.\n",
    "      - **Individual Issue.** Purpose is to describe feature purpose and describe progress toward CPT requirements.  The Individual Issue is a burndown list and will be used in Group and Individual reviews.  \n",
    "      - **Kanban Board** Purpose is to contain Team or Individual burndown items.  Issues are used to grow project in iterative increments.  One of more issues are used to support the burndown of Team and Individual Issues.  \n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Team Organization**\n",
    "     - **Team Size**. As close to 6 people as possible.\n",
    "     - **Leadership** One Scrum Master, and one asistant/backup Scrum Master.  \n",
    "     - **Integrations** There will be 2 people with rights to pull code into the repository.\n",
    "     - **Deployment Admins** There will be 2 people in project with rights to deploy.\n",
    "     - **Visual Design** There will be 1 person that maintains front end design documentation.\n",

    "     - **Coders** Everyone will have frontend and backend coding responsibilities for their person end to end feature.\n",
    "     - **Multiple Roles/Hats** You will likely have mutliple jobs and multiple coding responsibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Classroom Reviews**\n",
    "    - **Groups/Individual** Reviews will always be 3 people\n",
    "      - **Individual Issue and Kanband Issue(s)** Showing leveraged and distinction of features.  Highly focussed on code and data updates.\n",
    "      - **Expectation** This review will clearly show distinct coding on frontend and backend features.   Burndown of CPT features highlights CPT questionare/writeup.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Team/Table** Reviews will be 6 people\n",
    "      - **Team Issue and Kanban** Showing coordinated progress on Team Goals.  Higly focussed on demo and functionality.\n",
    "      - **Expectation* will require coordination and design.\n",
    "   - There will be frequent checkpoints: team, individual, or both.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Extending ideas for your group Social Media Project**:\n",
    "   - Your project should have designs for signup, login, and your social media features and actions.\n",
    "   - Additional areas of consideration that must be considered:\n",
    "     - Jinja MVC [admin menu](https://flask2025.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/login?next=/users/table2)\n",
    "     - Home Page [design](https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/flocker_frontend/)\n",
    "     - Additional features mentioned below for an \"A\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Teaching Elements**:\n",
    "   - There are distinct elements on Big Ideas 1, 2, 3, 4 in your project.  Consider how you will capture these elements in you personal blog to aid in your review and stuy.\n",
    "   - We will have an MCQ test in this Sprint to help support your personal blog build up and College Board MCQ preparation."
