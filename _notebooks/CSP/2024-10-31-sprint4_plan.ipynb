    "1. **Breaking out your own Social Media Project**.  Objective is to create something that belongs to you and could potentially lead to your CPT project.  There will only be one person with rights to to pull code into the repository, teams will be 3 people, tables will be 6 people.  We will plan leadership off of one Scrum Master and Integrator per 6 people.  But teams of 3 will have very distinct features.  This work will require coordination and design.  There will be frequent checkpoints.   The first checkpoints will show that you are meeting Big Idea 1.1 to 1.3 requirements in planning, coordination, as well as meeting all the requirements for CPT.  Read the CPT requirements and start a planning breakdown.\n",
