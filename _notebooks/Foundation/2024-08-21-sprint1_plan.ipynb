    "Each sprint will include hacks and project-based learning requirements. It is up to each individual to develop their own plan for representing their work. Here are some links and tips:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All work and tangible artifacts will be captured in a personal GitHub Issue\n",
    "- To obtain clarity on instructions, you should start a task, work with a peer, and then ask questions of the Teacher\n",
    "\n",
    "In Education, there is a framework called **Bloom's Taxonomy** which represents the standards for learning. We will use these levels to guide your technical evaluation for this Sprint:\n",
    "  - **üìù Remember** - Recall facts and basic concepts about tools and commands\n",
    "  - **üí° Understand** - Explain how tools work and their purpose in development workflow  \n",
    "  - **‚öôÔ∏è Apply** - Perform basic setup, installation, and coding tasks\n",
    "  - **üîç Analyze** - Troubleshoot problems by examining logs, error messages, and system behavior\n",
    "  - **üìä Evaluate** - Assess and correct errors, compare solutions, and make correct tool choices\n",
    "  - **üé® Create** - Produce original code, customize configurations, and add to projects\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Agile Development** methodology, which we will learn throughout the course, the focus is on delivery, iteration, and management (plans, designs, code, test,reviews, deploy, and continuous improvement). We will use these principles to guide your soft skills evaluation for this Sprint:\n",

    "  - **Iterative techniques** - Refining work through cycles\n",
    "  - **Continuous delivery** - Consistently producing quality work\n",

    "> - There are very few \"correct answers\" in this class! As you code, you will see there are always more mistakes to be made, features and bugs to work on\n",
    "> - Those who achieve high grades typically engage in work that interests them, talk a lot in class about work with peers, and learn to be comfortable sharing mistakes and failures\n",
    "> - You will earn points if you can \"show\" that you are progressing on your Computer Science journey - the checklist below helps form those habits\n",
    "> - Corporations in America are paying insane amounts of money to those who improve and expedite their work with AI usage, read about META\n",
    "> - **Junior Developer: $85,000+ | Scrum Master: $110,000+ | Senior Developer: $120,000+ | AI-Skilled Developer: $150,000+ | AI-Skilled Developer/Manager: $250,000++**\n",
    "> - **The highest-paid roles require both coding AND people skills - just like what we practice in this classroom!**\n",
    "> - **More than the money, it provides satisfaction to get out of your shell and \"create\"**"

    "- **üõ†Ô∏è Hands-On Learning**: Your laptop is your primary learning tool. Sprint 1 focuses on mastering your development environment.\n",
