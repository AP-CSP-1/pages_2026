    "## Sprint 1 – Task-Centered Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the **Open Coding Society**. Each year, we onboard over **200 new students** into our Computer Science pathways.  \n",
    "This year, **you** are not just a learner — you are a **Learning Experience Designer**, using Learning Experience Design (LxD) methods, namely Design Thinking. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your mission: **improve the onboarding process** for future students by designing and documenting training resources that live on our GitHub Pages site (pages.opencodingsociety.com).  \n",
    "You will *experience* the onboarding process first-hand, then *build* and *refine* it for the next generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem\n",
    "New students often feel overwhelmed in their first weeks: new tools, unfamiliar workflows, and unclear expectations. Your job is to reduce this friction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Goal\n",
    "By the end of this sprint, you will:\n",
    "- Be familiar with our essential development tools.\n",
    "- Have your own team and individual GitHub Pages site online.\n",
    "- Contribute one improvement to the onboarding content.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏢 Real-World Connection\n",
    "This workflow mirrors **industry software development**:\n",
    "- **Team repositories** = Enterprise codebases where multiple developers collaborate\n",
    "- **Personal forks** = Individual contributor branches and portfolios\n",
    "- **Pull requests** = Code review and integration processes used by companies like Google, Microsoft, and Meta\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Experience Design (LxD)** professionals use similar collaborative methods when building educational technology, online courses, and training platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "Future students will follow the steps you create. If you succeed, you will leave a lasting impact on hundreds of learners who come after you.\n",

    "## Activation – Building on What You Already Know\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into tools and code, let’s tap into knowledge you already have. Even without programming experience, you’ve worked with ideas that will help you succeed as a Learning Experience Designer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Familiar Learning Concepts\n",
    "You’ve likely used:\n",
    "- **Rubrics** – scoring guides that set clear expectations.  \n",
    "- **Checklists** – step-by-step task trackers to ensure nothing gets missed.  \n",
    "- **Assessments** – quizzes, reflections, or projects used to measure progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have also heard:\n",
    "- **Action verbs (Bloom’s)** – words like **Remember**, **Understand**, **Apply**, **Analyze**, **Evaluate**, **Create** that describe different levels of thinking.  \n",
    "- **The 4C’s** – skills often discussed among teachers: **Communication**, **Collaboration**, **Critical Thinking**, and **Creativity**, which make teams stronger and projects more effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How These Apply Here\n",
    "These tools and concepts aren’t “coding” skills, but they *are* design skills.  \n",
    "You’ll use them to:\n",
    "1. Plan your onboarding improvements clearly and effectively.  \n",
    "2. Communicate instructions so they are easy for others to follow.  \n",
    "3. Break large problems into smaller, manageable steps.  \n",
    "4. Review your work using criteria you and your peers help define.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Remember:** You are both a **learner** and a **designer** in this sprint. Everything you experience as a new student is insight you can turn into a better onboarding process for the next class. A key skill in LxD and Design Thinking is understanding and empathizing with the learner so you can define and ideate improvements.\n",

    "In this phase, the Teacher will walk you through the essential tools you’ll use to build and improve code; these are the results of the onboarding process:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **VSCode** – The code editor where you’ll write your Markdown, JavaScript, and other files.  \n",
    "- **VSCode Marketplace** – How to find and install useful extensions that make coding easier and more efficient.  \n",
    "- **Make** – Using Makefiles to automate repetitive tasks like building and deploying your site.  \n",
    "- **GitHub Commits** – How to save and document your changes in your code repository.  \n",
    "- **GitHub Actions** – Automated workflows that build and publish your GitHub Pages site whenever you push updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You’ll See\n",
    "\n",
    "- Opening VSCode and review the key extensions from the Marketplace.  \n",
    "- Creating a simple commit in GitHub via VSCode.  \n",
    "- Triggering a GitHub Action to publish your site automatically.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Fork to Your Team Repository**  \n",
    "   - Individuals work on your own repo and create PRs to others.\n",
    "   - Groups of 3 work together on a branch withing the fork.\n",
    "   - Teams of 6 coordinate together and manage main and PRs amongst teams.\n",
    "   - Teams **pull updates** from the OCS repo if changes are made.  \n",
    "   - Aim to submit **at least one Pull Request (PR)** to the OCS repo to improve it for future students.\n",
