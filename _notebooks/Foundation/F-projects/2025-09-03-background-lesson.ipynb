    "<br>\n",
    "In order for anything to show up on your screen in the first place, we have to create a canvas for everything to be drawn on.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to need to **declare a constant variable** using the keyword ``const``\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "const canvas = document.getElementById(\"world\");\n",
    "// document.getElementById(\"world\") finds the <canvas id=\"world\"> element in the DOM.\n",
    "\n",
    "const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');\n",
    "// every canvas has a drawing context. for example, getContext('2d') returns the 2D drawing API (methods like drawImage, fillRect, clearRect).\n",
    "// canvas is the DOM element; ctx is what draws pixels\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sizing the Canvas \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Now, we need to size the canvas to the window. Again, this is so the things being drawn isn't too small or too big for your window screen. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```js\n",
    "const canvasWidth = window.innerWidth;\n",
    "const canvasHeight = window.innerHeight;\n",
    "\n",
    "canvas.width = canvasWidth;\n",
    "canvas.height = canvasHeight;\n",
    "canvas.style.width = `${canvasWidth}px`;\n",
    "canvas.style.height = `${canvasHeight}px`;\n",
    "```\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "`canvas.width` / `canvas.height` set the drawing buffer size (pixel resolution of the canvas).\n",
    "\n",
    "`canvas.style.width` / `canvas.style.height` set the **CSS** size (how big it appears on screen).\n",
    "They set both equal so the drawing area matches the visible size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Game Objects\n",
    "<br> In our game, everything that shows up on the screen (like the background or the character sprite) can be thought of as a **game object**. Instead of writing separate code for each image, we create a **class** that acts like a blueprint.\n",
    "``` js\n",
    "class GameObject {\n",
    "  constructor(image, width, height, x = 0, y = 0, speedRatio = 0) {\n",
    "    this.image = image;       // what picture to draw\n",
    "    this.width = width;       // how wide to draw it\n",
    "    this.height = height;     // how tall to draw it\n",
    "    this.x = x;               // where it is horizontally\n",
    "    this.y = y;               // where it is vertically\n",
    "    this.speedRatio = speedRatio;\n",
    "    this.speed = gameSpeed * this.speedRatio; // how fast it moves\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  update() {\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of hardcoding the background or sprite separately, we can now make them instances of this `GameObject` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background Object\n",
    "<br> Our background is special: it has to **move sideways** forever to look like we’re running. To make it seamless, we draw **two copies** of the background image side-by-side. As one scrolls off the screen, the other one takes its place. \n",
    "``` js\n",
    "class Background extends GameObject {\n",
    "  update() {\n",
    "    this.x = (this.x - this.speed) % this.width;\n",
    "  }\n",
    "  draw(ctx) {\n",
    "    ctx.drawImage(this.image, this.x, this.y, this.width, this.height);\n",
    "    ctx.drawImage(this.image, this.x + this.width, this.y, this.width, this.height);\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`update()` moves the background a little bit every frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "The % this.width (modulo) makes sure it “wraps around” so it never disappears.\n",
    "\n",
    "`draw()` paints two backgrounds so there’s no empty gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Game Loop (Animation)\n",
    "<br> The most important piece of a game is the **loop** that keeps running forever. This is where things get updated and redrawn, frame after frame.\n",
    "```js\n",
    "function gameLoop() {\n",
    "  ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvasWidth, canvasHeight);\n",
    "  backgroundObj.update();\n",
    "  backgroundObj.draw(ctx);\n",
    "  playerObj.update();\n",
    "  playerObj.draw(ctx);\n",
    "  requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop);\n",
    "}\n",
    "gameLoop();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`clearRect` wipes the screen so old frames don’t overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "`update` changes object positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "`draw` puts the new images onto the canvas.\n",
    "\n",
    "`requestAnimationFrame` tells the browser: “do this again on the next frame.”\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s what makes the background look alive — it’s being redrawn 60 times per second!\n",
