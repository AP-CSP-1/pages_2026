    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Animated characters, objects, or backgrounds have been an essential part of videogames. Many iconic games, such as Super Mario Bros, have used sprite animation to bring their characters to life, and make their products more engaging and visually appealing. This blog is a brief exploration of how javascript is used to create your own simple animations using sprites. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Spritesheet Deinfition\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create the animation, you need to find an image which contains each individual frame side by side, also known as a spritesheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Animation is achieved by quickly sequencing through a series of still images in code, allowing the images to appear as if they are moving.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spritesheet Example\n",
    "\n",
    "This spritesheet is used for a player in the game.  Each row represents a different orientation of movement left-right-up-down.\n",
