    "**Lesson Overview: Building an Adventure plus Platformer game**\n",
    "In this game help system and notebooks, we will guide future developers through a step-by-step process of creating all of the key components of this game. The help system is broken down into various categories (using front matter), each category focusses on a specific aspect of the game, implementation, and suggests hacks for deeper learning. By the end of reviewing the help topics, you will have better understanding of the platformer game components and be encouraged to extend the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Category 1-Player: Setting Up the Player Character**\n",
    "- Learn how to set up the game canvas using HTML and JavaScript.\n",
    "- Create the player character class with attributes like position, velocity, and dimensions.\n",
    "- Implement basic player movement and physics, including gravity and jumping.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Category 2-Platform: Designing Platforms and Collision Detection**\n",
    "- Design and draw platforms on the canvas.\n",
    "- Implement collision detection between the player character and platforms.\n",
    "- Enable the player to walk and jump on platforms while accounting for gravity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Category 3-Finish: Traveling through Levels**\n",
    "- Render tubes or other obstactles that allow the player to transition between different levels.\n",
    "- Add an element of exploration and hidden secrets using connections.\n",
    "- Consider alternat endings.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Develop a mechanism for the player to interact with blocks through collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Category 5-Enemies: Implementing Enemies**\n",
    "- Introduce enemy characters (ie Goombas) that move independently across platforms.\n",
    "- Define enemy behavior, including collision interactions with the player character.\n",
    "- Create a system to defeat enemies through collision, jumping, shooting, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Category 6-Background: Creating a Dynamic Background**\n",
    "- Craft a visually appealing background that complements the game's theme.\n",
