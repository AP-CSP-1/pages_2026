    "In the Adventure plus Plaformer game help system and notebooks, we will guide future developers through a step-by-step process of creating all of the key components of this game. The help system is broken down into various categories (using front matter), each category focusses on a specific aspect of the game, implementation, and suggests hacks for deeper learning. By the end of reviewing the help topics, you will have better understanding of the platformer game components and be encouraged to extend the game."

Players earn emerald points as they correctly answer the questions. These emeralds are then stored in a virtual chest located in the RPG hub. (Shayan and Tanisha)\n",
    "Enemy interactions cause certain dialougues : The game could call back to earlier NPC dialogues that referenced the importance of avoiding creepers. For example, if the player fails to avoid the creeper in the platformer, the NPC might now say, “I warned you about those creepers. Your emeralds are at risk now.” (Nico and Tanisha)\n"
