    "Let's look at some simple examples and explain each line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example 1: Simple Boolean assignment\n",
    "is_sunny = True\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- `is_sunny` is a variable that stores a Boolean value. Here, it is set to **True**, meaning it is sunny.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example 2: Boolean from a comparison\n",
    "is_adult = 18 >= 18\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- `18 >= 18` checks if 18 is greater than or equal to 18. This is **True**.\n",
    "- `is_adult` will be assigned the value **True**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example 3: Using Booleans in an if statement\n",
    "age = 16\n",
    "if age >= 18:\n",
    "    print(\"You are an adult.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"You are not an adult.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- `age` is set to 16.\n",
    "- `if age >= 18:` checks if `age` is at least 18. This is **False**.\n",
    "- Since the condition is **False**, the code in the `else` block runs, printing \"You are not an adult.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Example 4: Boolean operators\n",
    "is_raining = False\n",
    "is_cold = True\n",
    "if is_raining or is_cold:\n",
    "    print(\"Bring a jacket!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- `is_raining` is **False**, `is_cold` is **True**.\n",
    "- `or` checks if at least one condition is **True**. Since `is_cold` is **True**, the message \"Bring a jacket!\" is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Summary\n",
    "- Booleans are **True** or **False** values.\n",
    "- They are used for decision making in code.\n",
    "- You can create Booleans directly, from comparisons, or by combining conditions with operators like `and`, `or`, and `not`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Booleans are everywhere in programming, and understanding them is key to writing effective code!**"
