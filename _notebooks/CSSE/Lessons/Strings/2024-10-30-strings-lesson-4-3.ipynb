    "# Lesson: Understanding Strings in JavaScript\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Are Strings?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Primitive Data Types**: Strings are considered primitive data types in JavaScript. This means they are immutable, meaning once created, their value cannot change.\n",
    "- **Formatted Similar to Python**: You can define strings using single (`'`) or double (`\"`) quotes, and the indexing starts at 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create strings in JavaScript in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "console.log(\"simple way to display strings\"); \n",
    "// 'string literal' is what's in your code, 'String value' is what's displayed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Using variables to store strings allows for more flexibility:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const stringExample = \"another example of printing a string\";\n",
    "console.log(stringExample);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Handling Apostrophes\n",
    "\n",
    "If your string contains an apostrophe and you're using single quotes, you need to escape it with a backslash (`\\`):\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "console.log(\"the dog said \\\"where is my food\\\" as the owner left\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concatenating Strings\n",
    "\n",
    "You can concatenate strings using the `+` operator:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const mascot = \"night\" + \"hawk\";\n",
    "console.log(mascot);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Concatenating multiple variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const fish1 = \"pufferfish\";\n",
    "const fish2 = \"marlin\";\n",
    "const fish3 = \"salmon\";\n",
    "const favFish = \"My favorite fish species are \" + fish1 + \", \" + fish2 + \", and \" + fish3 + \".\";\n",
    "console.log(favFish);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Template Literals\n",
    "\n",
    "Template literals provide an easier and more readable way to concatenate strings using backticks (`` ` ``):\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const favFishMethodTwo = `My favorite fish species are ${fish1}, ${fish2}, and ${fish3}.`;\n",
    "console.log(favFishMethodTwo);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also include line breaks using template literals:\n",
    "\n",
    "```javascript\n",
    "const riddle = `my favorite animal\n",
    "hibernates during the winter\n",
    "in a cave`;\n",
    "console.log(riddle);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## JavaScript String Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Since strings can be treated as objects in JavaScript, you can utilize various methods to manipulate them. Refer to [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String) for a comprehensive list of JavaScript string methods."
