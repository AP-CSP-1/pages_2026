    "# Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are methods?\n",
    "- Reusable code that performs specific tasks.\n",
    "- Helps break down programs into manageable parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Parts of a Method:\n",
    "- Modifier: Describes the method's properties.\n",
    "    - Access Modifiers: Determines who can access the method `(e.g., public, private)`.\n",
    "        - `public`: Accessible everywhere.\n",
    "        - `private`: Accessible only within the class.\n",
    "        - `protected`: Accessible within the package and subclasses.\n",
    "        - Default (no modifier): Accessible within the package.\n",
    "    - Non-Access Modifiers: Additional properties of the method `(e.g., static, final)`.\n",
    "        - `static`: Belongs to the class, not the object.\n",
    "        - `final`: Cannot be overridden.\n",
    "- Method name: Defines the method `(e.g., public int add(int a, int b))`.\n",
    "- Return Types: Specifies what the method returns `(int, void, etc.)`.\n",
    "- Parameters: Inputs for dynamic behavior.\n",
    "- Method Body: Contains the code to be executed.\n",
    "![image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:630/0*bt3A3cwsE3TeIDDP.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Methods:\n",
    "- Instance: Belongs to objects (e.g., myObject.method()).\n",
    "- Static: Belongs to the class (e.g., ClassName.method()).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Control Structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conditional Statements:\n",
    "- Use if, else if, and else to make decisions.\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "if (x > 0) {\n",
    "    System.out.println(\"Positive\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loops:\n",
    "- Repeat code using:\n",
    "    - **`for`**: Known iterations (e.g., `for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)`). \n",

    "## Tips for Tackling Methods and Control Structures FRQs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reuse Existing Methods:**\n",
    "    - If methods are already defined, use them instead of writing your own.\n",
    "- **Loops:**\n",
    "    - Pay attention to for/while loop limits to avoid infinite loops or skipping conditions.\n",
    "\t- Avoid using break or continue unless explicitly required.\n",
    "- **Return Statements:**\n",
    "\t- Double-check what needs to be returned and ensure the return type matches the expected variable type.\n",
    "\t- Be mindful of return placement in loops; returning inside a loop will terminate both the loop and the method.\n",
    "- **Watch for Method Requirements:**\n",
    "\t- Each question or sub-part may specify, “To get full credit, you must use method XYZ.” Read carefully and follow instructions for each part.\n",
    "- **Single-Class vs. Multi-Class Questions:**\n",
    "\t- Single-class questions focus on concepts within one class\n",
    "\t- Multi-class questions require interactions between classes\n",
    "- **Conditional Statements and Loops:**\n",
    "\t- Expect basic concepts like `if`, `if-else`, `while`, `for`, and nested loops.\n",
    "\t- Strings are also common in these questions.\n",
    "- **Calling Methods:**\n",
    "\t- Same Class: Call methods directly (e.g., `methodName()`).\n",
    "\t- Multi-Class: Use an instance of the other class (e.g., `object.methodName()`) or the class name for static methods (e.g., `ClassName.methodName()`).\n",
    "- **Common Algorithms to Practice:**\n",
    "\t- Searching (e.g., linear search).\n",
    "\t- Finding maximum or minimum values.\n",
    "\t- Counting specific occurrences (e.g., vowels in a string, even numbers in an array).\n",
    "\n",
    "### FRQ Question 1 on Control Structures will probably involve:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A for-loop that probably uses the method’s parameter variables,\n",
    "- An if statement, probably inside the loop,\n",
    "- Calls to other class methods given to you,\n",
    "- A numerical or string value that is calculated by the loop and returned at the end of the method.\n",
    "- If the question has 2 parts, 1 part will probably require a loop and the other just an expression.\n",

In this case, the return type of `numberOfLeapYears` is **int** and you need to calculate the number of leap years between `year1` and `year2` and return it. Declare a variable for this return value and return it at the end of the method to get 1 point.\n",

    "Correct answer: **iv. Loop from year1 to year2** because we need to count the number of leap years between year1 and year2. i and ii are incorrect because we need to loop from year1 to year2 and not from the beginning of time. iii is incorrect because it is not related to the problem.\n",
