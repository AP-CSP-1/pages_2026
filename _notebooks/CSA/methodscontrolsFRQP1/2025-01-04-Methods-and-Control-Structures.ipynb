    "## Key Parts of a Method:\n",
    "- Declaration: Defines the method `(e.g., public int add(int a, int b))`.\n",
    "- Return Types: Specifies what the method returns `(int, void, etc.)`.\n",
    "- Parameters: Inputs for dynamic behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Methods:\n",
    "- Instance: Belongs to objects (e.g., myObject.method()).\n",
    "- Static: Belongs to the class (e.g., ClassName.method()).\n",

    "## Conditional Statements:\n",
    "- Use if, else if, and else to make decisions.\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "```java\n",
