    "# Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are methods?\n",
    "- Reusable code that performs specific tasks.\n",
    "- Helps break down programs into manageable parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Parts of a Method:\n",
    "- Modifier: Describes the method's properties.\n",
    "    - Access Modifiers: Determines who can access the method `(e.g., public, private)`.\n",
    "        - `public`: Accessible everywhere.\n",
    "        - `private`: Accessible only within the class.\n",
    "        - `protected`: Accessible within the package and subclasses.\n",
    "        - Default (no modifier): Accessible within the package.\n",
    "    - Non-Access Modifiers: Additional properties of the method `(e.g., static, final)`.\n",
    "        - `static`: Belongs to the class, not the object.\n",
    "        - `final`: Cannot be overridden.\n",
    "- Method name: Defines the method `(e.g., public int add(int a, int b))`.\n",
    "- Return Types: Specifies what the method returns `(int, void, etc.)`.\n",
    "- Parameters: Inputs for dynamic behavior.\n",
    "- Method Body: Contains the code to be executed.\n",
    "![image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:630/0*bt3A3cwsE3TeIDDP.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Methods:\n",
    "- Instance: Belongs to objects (e.g., myObject.method()).\n",
    "- Static: Belongs to the class (e.g., ClassName.method()).\n",
    "\n",
    "# Control Structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conditional Statements:\n",
    "- Use if, else if, and else to make decisions.\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "if (x > 0) {\n",
    "    System.out.println(\"Positive\");\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loops:\n",
    "- Repeat code using:\n",
    "    - **`for`**: Known iterations (e.g., `for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)`). \n",

    "## Tips for Tackling Methods and Control Structures FRQs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reuse Existing Methods:**\n",
    "    - If methods are already defined, use them instead of writing your own.\n",
    "- **Loops:**\n",
    "    - Pay attention to for/while loop limits to avoid infinite loops or skipping conditions.\n",
    "\t- Avoid using break or continue unless explicitly required.\n",
    "- **Return Statements:**\n",
    "\t- Double-check what needs to be returned and ensure the return type matches the expected variable type.\n",
    "\t- Be mindful of return placement in loops; returning inside a loop will terminate both the loop and the method.\n",
    "- **Watch for Method Requirements:**\n",
    "\t- Each question or sub-part may specify, “To get full credit, you must use method XYZ.” Read carefully and follow instructions for each part.\n",
    "- **Single-Class vs. Multi-Class Questions:**\n",
    "\t- Single-class questions focus on concepts within one class\n",
    "\t- Multi-class questions require interactions between classes\n",
    "- **Conditional Statements and Loops:**\n",
    "\t- Expect basic concepts like `if`, `if-else`, `while`, `for`, and nested loops.\n",
    "\t- Strings are also common in these questions.\n",
    "- **Calling Methods:**\n",
    "\t- Same Class: Call methods directly (e.g., `methodName()`).\n",
    "\t- Multi-Class: Use an instance of the other class (e.g., `object.methodName()`) or the class name for static methods (e.g., `ClassName.methodName()`).\n",
    "- **Common Algorithms to Practice:**\n",
    "\t- Searching (e.g., linear search).\n",
    "\t- Finding maximum or minimum values.\n",
    "\t- Counting specific occurrences (e.g., vowels in a string, even numbers in an array)."
