    "\n",
    "Create a Java program that calculates and displays player statistics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Variables** (you can hardcode these):\n",
    "   - Player name\n",
    "   - Current level (1-50)\n",
    "   - Base health: 100\n",
    "   - Base damage: 20\n",
    "   - Base mana: 50\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculations Required**:\n",
    "   - Scaled health = base health √ó (1.15)<sup>level</sup> [use Math.pow()]\n",
    "   - Scaled damage = base damage √ó (1.10)<sup>level</sup> [use Math.pow()]\n",
    "   - Scaled mana = base mana √ó (1.12)<sup>level</sup> [use Math.pow()]\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **Output**:\n",
    "   - Display all original and scaled stats in a formatted way\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Given Positions** (hardcode these):\n",
    "   - Player position: (15, 25)\n",
    "   - Enemy 1 position: (45, 60)\n",
    "   - Enemy 2 position: (80, 20)\n",
    "   - Health Pack position: (50, 50)\n",
    "   - Exit Portal position: (90, 90)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calculations Required**:\n",
    "   - Calculate distance from player to each location using: ‚àö[(x‚ÇÇ-x‚ÇÅ)¬≤ + (y‚ÇÇ-y‚ÇÅ)¬≤]\n",
    "   - Use Math.sqrt() and Math.pow()\n",
    "   - Round distances to 2 decimal places\n",
    "   - Determine which enemy is closest [use Math.min()]\n",
    "   - Calculate if player is within attack range of closest enemy (range = 40 units)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Decision Logic**:\n",
    "   - If closest enemy is within 40 units: \"ATTACK MODE\"\n",
    "   - If closest enemy is 40-60 units: \"CAUTION - MOVE TO COVER\"\n",
    "   - If closest enemy is 60+ units: \"SAFE - COLLECT HEALTH PACK\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Bonus** (+5 points):\n",
    "   - Calculate the optimal path (should player go to health pack first or exit?)\n",

    "   - Epic: 151-500 gold\n",

    "   - For player level > 10: multiply all gold by 1.5\n",
    "   - For player level > 25: multiply all gold by 2.0\n",
    "   - For player level > 40: multiply all gold by 3.0\n",
