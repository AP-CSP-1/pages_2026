    "**Scenario:** You're developing a competitive gaming platform where you need to calculate player statistics in real-time. Players are complaining that the leaderboard shows incorrect rankings because basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) aren't enough for advanced calculations like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Power levels**: A player's damage output = base damage Ã— (1.5)<sup>level</sup>\n",
    "- **Distance calculations**: Finding the shortest path between two points on a map\n",
    "- **Random loot drops**: Generating fair random numbers for item drops\n",
    "- **Critical hit angles**: Calculating projectile trajectories using trigonometry\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Mission:** Without the Java Math class, these calculations are nearly impossible to implement efficiently. Can you imagine manually calculating square roots or trigonometric functions? \n",

    "### ðŸ¤” Activate Your Prior Knowledge\n",

    "Before we dive in, think about:\n",
    "1. Have you ever used a calculator for powers or square roots? What buttons did you press?\n",
    "2. In what real-world situations might you need to calculate distances, angles, or generate random numbers?\n",
    "3. If you've coded before, how did you handle complex mathematical operations?\n",

    "**Quick Discussion (30 seconds):** Share with your neighbor one time you needed a calculation beyond basic +, -, *, /"
