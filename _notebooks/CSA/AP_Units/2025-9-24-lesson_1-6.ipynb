    "# Compound Assignment Operators (AP CS A, Unit 1.6)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Are They?\n",
    "##### A **compound assignment operator** combines an arithmetic (or other) operation with assignment in one statement.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**For example, instead of writing:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "score = score + 10;\n",
    "```\n",
    "**You can write:**\n",
    "```java\n",
    "score += 10;\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Learning Goals\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:\n",
    "- Transform clunky `x = x + y` statements into sleek compound assignments\n",
    "- Master all the essential operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `++`, `--`)\n",
    "- Understand evaluation order and avoid common traps\n",
    "- Write code that looks like it was written by a pro, not a beginner\n",

    "3. Expecting ```++``` or ```--``` to work in prefix form (```++x```) — out of scope.\n",

    "### Important Rules to keep in mind (AP Test-Specific):\n",
    "1. You can only use these when the variable on the left already exists and has a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The right-hand side (RHS) is fully evaluated first; then the operation is applied; then the result is assigned back.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Java may do an implicit narrowing conversion when the LHS is a smaller primitive type (e.g. ```short```, ```byte```).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Integer division: when you divide two ints, the fractional part is truncated. Be careful with ```/=```.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. ```%``` (modulo) operation for negatives preserves the sign of the left operand in Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Only post-form (```x++```, ```x--```) is in scope for the AP exam. Prefix forms (++x) are out of scope."
