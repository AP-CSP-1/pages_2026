    "## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals\n",
    "- Understand what compound assignment operators are and how they relate to full assignment (e.g. `x = x + y`).\n",
    "- Know the common operators (`+=, -=, *=, /=, %=`) and what they do.\n",
    "- Learn about increment (`++`) and decrement (`--`) operators in post-form (since prefix is out of scope for the AP exam).\n",
    "- Be able to trace evaluation order, including how the RHS is evaluated first, type conversions / narrowing, then assignment.\n",
    "- Be aware of common pitfalls: using before initialization, confusing post vs pre, type mismatches.\n",

    "2. The right-hand side (RHS) is fully evaluated first; then the operation is applied; then the result is assigned back.\n",
