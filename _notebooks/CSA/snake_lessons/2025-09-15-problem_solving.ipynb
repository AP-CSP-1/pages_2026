    "\n",
    "### Systematic Problem-Solving Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Isolate the Issue**\n",
    "   - Identify exactly when the problem occurs (game start, movement, collision, etc.)\n",
    "   - Use `console.log()` to track variable values at different points\n",
    "   - Test one feature at a time to narrow down the source\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Understand the Data Flow**\n",
    "   - Snake position: Array of `{x, y}` objects\n",
    "   - Direction: Numeric values (0=Up, 1=Right, 2=Down, 3=Left)\n",
    "   - Game state: Screen constants and boolean flags\n",
    "   - Canvas coordinates: Grid-based positioning system\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Common Snake Game Challenges**\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Challenge: Snake passes through itself**\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   // Problem: Insufficient collision detection\n",
    "   // Solution: Check all body segments\n",
    "   for(let i = 1; i < snake.length; i++){\n",
    "       if (snake[0].x === snake[i].x && snake[0].y === snake[i].y){\n",
    "           // Collision detected\n",
    "       }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Challenge: Food spawns on snake body**\n",
    "   ```javascript\n",
    "   // Problem: Random placement without validation\n",
    "   // Solution: Recursive placement checking\n",
    "   let addFood = function(){\n",
    "       // Generate position\n",
    "       food.x = Math.floor(Math.random() * ((canvas.width / BLOCK) - 1));\n",
    "       food.y = Math.floor(Math.random() * ((canvas.height / BLOCK) - 1));\n",
    "       \n",
    "       // Validate placement\n",
    "       for(let i = 0; i < snake.length; i++){\n",
    "           if(checkBlock(food.x, food.y, snake[i].x, snake[i].y)){\n",
    "               addFood(); // Try again\n",
    "           }\n",
    "       }\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Design Patterns in Snake\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pattern 1: State Machine**\n",
    "- Screen management uses discrete states (menu, game, settings)\n",
    "- Each state has specific allowed transitions\n",
    "- Centralized state control prevents invalid states\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pattern 2: Game Loop**\n",
    "- Continuous execution cycle: input → update → render → repeat\n",
    "- Fixed time steps using `setTimeout` for consistent gameplay\n",
    "- Frame-independent logic for predictable behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pattern 3: Coordinate Grid System**\n",
    "- Abstract pixel coordinates into grid positions\n",
    "- Simplifies collision detection and movement logic\n",
    "- Enables easy boundary checking and wrapping\n",
    "\n",
    "### Development Workflow Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Plan Before Coding**\n",
    "   - Sketch out the feature's logic flow\n",
    "   - Identify which functions need modification\n",
    "   - Consider edge cases and error conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Incremental Development**\n",
    "   - Implement the simplest version first\n",
    "   - Test thoroughly before adding complexity\n",
    "   - Keep backup copies of working versions\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Code Organization**\n",
    "   - Group related functions together\n",
    "   - Use descriptive variable names\n",
    "   - Add comments explaining complex logic\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Testing Strategies**\n",
    "   - Test boundary conditions (edges, corners)\n",
    "   - Verify behavior at different speeds\n",
    "   - Check interaction between multiple features\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting Started Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start Small**: Begin with easy visual changes to build confidence\n",
    "2. **Test Frequently**: Make one change at a time and test thoroughly\n",
    "3. **Use Browser DevTools**: Debug issues as they arise\n",
    "4. **Document Changes**: Keep track of what you've modified\n",
    "5. **Think Systematically**: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced Problem-Solving Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rubber Duck Debugging**: Explain your code logic out loud to identify flaws\n",
    "\n",
    "**Divide and Conquer**: Split complex features into smaller, testable components\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trace Execution**: Follow variable values through each step of the game loop\n",
    "\n",
    "**Boundary Testing**: Always test extreme cases (empty snake, full screen, maximum speed)\n",
    "\n",
