    "### Systematic Problem-Solving Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Isolate the Issue**\n",
    "   - Identify exactly when the problem occurs (game start, movement, collision, etc.)\n",
    "   - Use `console.log()` to track variable values at different points\n",
    "   - Test one feature at a time to narrow down the source\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Understand the Data Flow**\n",
    "   - Snake position: Array of `{x, y}` objects\n",
    "   - Direction: Numeric values (0=Up, 1=Right, 2=Down, 3=Left)\n",
    "   - Game state: Screen constants and boolean flags\n",
    "   - Canvas coordinates: Grid-based positioning system\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Common Snake Game Challenges**\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Challenge: Snake passes through itself**\n",
    "   - Problem: Insufficient collision detection\n",
    "   - Solution: Check all body segments against head position\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Challenge: Food spawns on snake body**\n",
    "   - Problem: Random placement without validation\n",
    "   - Solution: Check new food position against all snake segments\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Design Patterns in Snake\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pattern 1: State Machine**\n",
    "- Screen management uses discrete states (menu, game, settings)\n",
    "- Each state has specific allowed transitions\n",
    "- Centralized state control prevents invalid states\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pattern 2: Game Loop**\n",
    "- Continuous execution cycle: input → update → render → repeat\n",
    "- Fixed time steps using `setTimeout` for consistent gameplay\n",
    "- Frame-independent logic for predictable behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pattern 3: Coordinate Grid System**\n",
    "- Abstract pixel coordinates into grid positions\n",
    "- Simplifies collision detection and movement logic\n",
    "- Enables easy boundary checking and wrapping\n",
    "\n",
    "### Development Workflow Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Plan Before Coding**\n",
    "   - Sketch out the feature's logic flow\n",
    "   - Identify which functions need modification\n",
    "   - Consider edge cases and error conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Incremental Development**\n",
    "   - Implement the simplest version first\n",
    "   - Test thoroughly before adding complexity\n",
    "   - Keep backup copies of working versions\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Testing Strategies**\n",
    "   - Test boundary conditions (edges, corners)\n",
    "   - Verify behavior at different speeds\n",
    "   - Check interaction between multiple features\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting Started Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start Small**: Begin with easy visual changes to build confidence\n",
    "2. **Test Frequently**: Make one change at a time and test thoroughly\n",
    "3. **Use Browser DevTools**: Debug issues as they arise\n",
    "4. **Document Changes**: Keep track of what you've modified\n",
    "5. **Think Systematically**: Break complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces\n",
    "\n",
