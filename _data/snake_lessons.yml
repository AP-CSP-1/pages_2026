    alt: "Frontend Development"
    keyPoints:
      - "HTML canvas and menus"
      - "CSS styling and transitions"
      - "DOM manipulation"
      - "Event handling and input"
    subtitle: "User Interface Design"
    description: "Players interact with multiple screens and controls. This demonstrates how frontend development creates visual interfaces, handles user input, and manages different game states through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript."
